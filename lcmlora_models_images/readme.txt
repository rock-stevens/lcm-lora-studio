All models saved from the 'Pipeline' will have an 
Image Gallery and Model Card created by default.

A directory for each model saved, will be created in this directory.
'Sent to Gallery' Images and the model card for that model will go into the directory.
The default model card saved is named 'modelname.md'
The model card is in Markdown language, but alot of model cards on the internet are already in Markdown. Maybe just copy/paste the 'md' file? :)

You can also edit the model card inside of the LCM-LoRA Studio UI


You can delete this file.
