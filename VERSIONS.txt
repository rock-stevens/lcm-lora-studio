### Version History

FIX: 	LCM-LoRA-Studio v1.3a

FIX:    LoRA Weights and LoRA Adapters were not getting unloaded and deleted when you click the 'Delete Model' button.
	Note: LoRA Adapters still could/can be deleted under the 'Add LoRA Models' tab. So this FIX is to prevent errors 
	caused by the user not unloading LoRAs 'before' deleting and/or loading another model.
		
FIX:	'Original Config' file and 'Reference model' for loading Single FIle Safetensors model types 
	now accounts for empty fields in the settings. As so there should be, because for the 'Original Config' 
	file, SDXL does not use them. So the user would have to go into settings and make sure that 
	option was un-chcecked before trying to load a model for a pipeline there is not a 
	'Original Config' file for. (I have those obvious not used fields for future expansion.)
		
	Now ignores all 'empty' fields in the settings for both 'Original Config' files and 'Reference models'. 
	Now the user can mostly leave 'Use Original Config' checked and just un-check it only when certain models refuse to load.


FIX:	Refreshed code comments which were left in since early production.
