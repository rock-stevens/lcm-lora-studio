Any LoRA Models downloaded from the internet should be placed in this directory.
Note: '*.safetensors' files only.

Hint: When saving your LoRA models from the internet, there is a way to make a model card and save demo images to go with it.
Also you may want to make sure an SDXL model has 'xl' somewhere in the filename. Or put that info in the model card you can make.
It weill certainly help later once you have a bunch of models.

See the readme.txt in the directory: 'lora_models_images' for a 'manual' model card information option


You can delete this file.
